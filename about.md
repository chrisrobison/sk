## About Us

We’re The Suicidal Kennedy’s. We are a fiercely satirical, politically-charged punk rock outfit with a neon-soaked comic book aesthetic and a biting sense of humor.

We blend old-school punk energy with clever, irreverent lyrics that tackle everything from government overreach to social media idiocy, billionaire bromances, and the soul-crushing compromises of adulthood.

We are here to scream into the static of late-stage capitalism, weaponize satire, distortion, and exhibit a healthy disrespect for authority. Our songs are protest anthems disguised as jokes, and jokes that hurt a little because they’re probably true.

At the center of our band is Jack, our skeletal mascot and leather-jacketed alter ego. He’s got JFK’s hair, Ray-Bans he never takes off, and the thousand-yard stare of someone who’s seen way too much C-SPAN. Jack’s not just a logo, he’s our witness, our accomplice, and our reminder that nothing is sacred, especially if it can’t take a joke.

Our sound is rooted in classic punk: raw, fast, no filler — but twisted through the filter of modern absurdity: corporate cults, dystopian tech, societal collapse, TikTok revolutionaries, and politicians who cosplay as kings. We write songs about caulk, billionaires, zombie congressmen, and the bureaucratic fever dreams of a nation glued together with duct tape and denial.

We’re not trying to sell you nostalgia. We’re not trying to save the scene. We’re here to laugh while the empire burns and make sure the last echo out of the fallout shelter is a riff worth remembering. If you're angry, exhausted, over-informed, underwhelmed, and still weirdly hopeful — welcome to the party. Noise ordinance ends at 10.

Core themes:

- Anti-authoritarianism
- Political satire
- Punk purity vs adult/life compromise
- Corporate absurdity
- Cultural decay (with a wink)
- Dark humor as survival

We’re like a Molotov cocktail thrown into late-stage capitalism — with excellent graphic design.

This is punk rock with teeth.  
This is satire with a power chord.  
This is The Suicidal Kennedy’s.
