<p>We’re The Suicidal Kennedy’s — a punk band screaming into the static
of late-stage capitalism, weaponizing satire, distortion, and a healthy
disrespect for authority. Our songs are protest anthems disguised as
jokes, and jokes that hurt a little because they’re probably true.</p>
<p>At the center of our band is Jack — our skeletal mascot and
leather-jacketed alter ego. He’s got JFK’s hair, Ray-Bans he never takes
off, and the thousand-yard stare of someone who’s seen way too much
C-SPAN. Jack’s not just a logo — he’s our witness, our accomplice, and
our reminder that nothing is sacred if it can’t take a punchline.</p>
<p>Our sound is rooted in classic punk — raw, fast, no filler — but
twisted through the filter of modern absurdity: corporate cults,
dystopian tech, HOA rebellions, TikTok revolutionaries, and politicians
who cosplay as kings. We write songs about caulk, billionaires, zombie
congressmen, and the bureaucratic fever dreams of a nation glued
together with duct tape and denial.</p>
<p>We’re not trying to sell you nostalgia. We’re not trying to save the
scene. We’re here to laugh while the empire burns and make sure the last
echo out of the fallout shelter is a riff worth remembering. If you’re
angry, exhausted, over-informed, underwhelmed, and still weirdly hopeful
— welcome to the party. Noise ordinance ends at 10.</p>
<p>This is punk rock with teeth.<br />
This is satire with a power chord.<br />
This is The Suicidal Kennedy’s.</p>
