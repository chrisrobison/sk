Cracked pavement and static on your morning screen
Dead eyes behind the podium, parading every scene
Shuffling their papers, but the ink is running thin
Hope gets buried while the pandering begins

Zombie congressmen take their marching orders high
Never mind the faces worn, just shuffle and comply
Voting red or blue, but they never wonder why
Brains on autopilot, never hear our cries

Hey oh, brains for sale (hey oh)
Hey oh, brains for sale

Lines drawn in sand no matter what the people need
Constituents ignored as the lobby books the feed
A hand up, a hand out, they're trading paper skin
Plaster on their grins, now the walking dead begin

We're shouting at their doors
But their minds are locked up tight
A stampede of empty suits
Dawn of the party line tonight

Zombie congressmen take their marching orders high
Never mind the faces worn, just shuffle and comply
Voting red or blue, but they never wonder why
Brains on autopilot, never hear our cries

Hey oh, brains for sale (hey oh)
Hey oh, brains for sale[Horn Solo]
Horns blare warnings as the brains go out to lunch
Another round of chaos served up with a punch
Truth decays in silence while they're locked inside that dome
Weâ€™re still screaming loud but getting sent straight home

Zombie congressmen take their marching orders high
Never mind the faces worn just shuffle and comply
Voting red or blue but they never wonder why
Brains on autopilot never hear our cries
