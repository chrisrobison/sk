[Start]
[Guitar/Horn Solo]
Horn blasts cut sharp through asphalt and fear
Strings rip wild as headlines appear
LAPD circling helicopters above
Barricades building but not enough love

[Verse 1]
Barrio sunrise the tension begins
Neighbors trade stories on how it got grim
Helicopters circling chasing their ghosts
Prayers for the families who need 'em the most
[Chorus]
Boots on Sunset marching through the night
Sirens wail and families held tight
Power games played in a tired machine
But we see the struggle painted on every street

[Post-Chorus]
Hey hey fighting for the rights
Oh oh liberty tonight

[Verse 2]
They came for the neighbors with dogs and shield lines
Truck lights shining as freedom unwinds
Commanded from towers a continent away
But hope burns stubborn, it doesn’t obey

[Pre-Chorus]
Blue and gold is flying, not turning to grey
Voices get louder, won’t let them decay

[Chorus]
Boots on Sunset marching through the night
Sirens wail and families held tight
Power games played in a tired machine
But we see the struggle painted on every street

[Post-Chorus]
Hey hey fighting for the rights
Oh oh liberty tonight
