[Start]
[Horn Intro]
Ba da ba ba ba da da
Ba da ba ba ba da da
Ba da ba ba

[Verse 1]
Morning sirens blaring down the street
Night patrols with a checklist sheet
Paper trails lost, no chance to plead
Hard times coming with a deadly speed
[Chorus]
Who’s gonna pick the fruit when the morning breaks
gone overnight yeah for all our sakes
dropped the hammer never saw the stakes
empty hands left holding only rage

[Post-Chorus]
Where’d they go where’d they go
ghost towns row by row

[Verse 2]
Tractors rusting under open sky
boss man cursing at another pie
no boots stomping on the muddy ground
dreams uprooted thrown out of town

[Pre-Chorus]
Swing the gavel like a wrecking ball
laws made quick, but work still calls
who’s gonna build your city walls
when everyone you need is gone?

[Chorus]
Who’s gonna pick the fruit when the morning breaks
gone overnight yeah for all our sakes
dropped the hammer never saw the stakes
empty hands left holding only rage

[Post-Chorus]
Where’d they go where’d they go
ghost towns row by row
