[Start]
[Guitar Intro]
Power chords ring out as I sit at my desk
Riffing the daydreams running through my head
Scrolling the endless feed for some delight
Online I’m loud, offline I stay out of sight
[Start]
Boot up my day, I’m ready to post
Snap a new pic, filter it the most
Followers climb but I’m stuck in my room
IRL me is out of tune

[Verse 1]
Screen name is bold, my avatar’s cool
Liked by a crowd I never met at school
DMs are fire, replies coming fast
But real conversations never last
[Chorus]
I’m cooler online, that’s what my profile says
Got the perfect lines and a thousand friends
IRL I’m weird, can’t look them in the eye
But I’m a legend behind my wifi

[Post-Chorus]
Type it up, hit send, feel alive
I’m cooler online, cooler online

[Verse 2]
Photoshopped grin, I’m living a meme
Scroll and pretend I know what I mean
Laughing emoji to cover the pain
Offline, my jokes don’t land the same

[Pre-Chorus]
Behind a screen, I’m everything I want to be
But face-to-face, I always freeze

[Chorus]
I’m cooler online, that’s what my profile says
Got the perfect lines and a thousand friends
IRL I’m weird, can’t look them in the eye
But I’m a legend behind my wifi

[Post-Chorus]
LOL, inside I’m not fine
I’m cooler online, cooler online
