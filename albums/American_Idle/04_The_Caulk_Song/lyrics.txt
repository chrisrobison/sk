[200~[Start]
[Verse 1]
Pulled out my caulk, so proud to display
Got latex and silicone, ready to slay
Smooth or chunky, white, brown or clear
Some for the bathroom, some for out here
Colors on the shelf, I can't decide
Flexible, waterproof, all bona fide
Thick as a milkshake, or runny as paint
Pick the right caulk so your job ain't faint
[Chorus]
Everybody’s got caulk on their mind
Got a gap, don’t worry, you’re gonna find
Fill it up, smooth it out, every single line
Caulk in your toolbox, gotta use it right

[Post-Chorus]
Caulk caulk, don’t let it dry (hey)
Caulk caulk, gotta keep it tight (woah)

[Verse 2]
Walked in the store asked for some caulk
Guy at the counter just started to gawk
He handed me a tube, I said with a smirk
“Hope this one fits, I’ve got a lotta work”

[Pre-Chorus]
White or clear, the choice is yours
Squeeze that trigger, open those doors

[Chorus]
Everybody’s got caulk on their mind
Got a gap, don’t worry, you’re gonna find
Fill it up, smooth it out, every single line
Caulk in your toolbox, gotta use it right

[Post-Chorus]
Caulk caulk, don’t let it dry (hey)
Caulk caulk, gotta keep it tight (woah)[201~
