Skateboard wheels on cracked cement
Another night just came and went
Spray paint hearts on brick-red walls
Laughing loud when duty calls
Early morning bus is late
Teachers glare and throw some shade
Eyes half-open, shoes untied
Still can't fake that dead inside

I'm sick of all your stupid rules
The way you act like we're all fools
Suburban life is killing me
I just wanna break free

Break free, break free!
Break free, break free!

Principal's office one more time
For a joke they called a crime
Parents freaking out again
While I'm hanging with my friends

They say I should grow up
But their lives just plain suck
Counting days till I can leave
This town that makes me heave

I'm sick of all your stupid rules
The way you act like we're all fools
Suburban life is killing me
I just wanna break free

Break free, break free!
Break free, break free!
