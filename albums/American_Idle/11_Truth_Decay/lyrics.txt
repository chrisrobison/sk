[Intro]
Welcome to the program, sit back in your seat
Headlines scream at you, orders on repeat
Every channel claims that they're the only guide
But the more you're watching, the less you decide

[Verse 1]
Scrolling through disasters splashed across the screen
Manufactured panic in red and green
Picking sides for profit, drama sold as fact
They're keeping us divided, never looking back
[Chorus]
Truth Decay eating away
The facts get twisted every day
Truth Decay what can we say
When headlines drive the rage

[Post-Chorus]
Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Verse 2]
Talking heads with their agendas set
Manufacturing outrage to collect
Left versus right, a false dichotomy
Selling fear instead of honesty

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn it off, tune it out
There's something better to talk about
Than partisan lies they're shouting out
While the real problems go without

[Chorus]
Truth Decay eating away
The facts get twisted every day
Truth Decay what can we say
When headlines drive the rage

[Post-Chorus]
Hey! Hey! Hey![Chorus]
Truth Decay eating away
The facts get twisted every day
Truth Decay what can we say
When headlines drive the rage

[Post-Chorus]
Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Outro]
Turn down the static, reclaim your head
Start questioning the narratives you’ve been fed
Switch off the circus, step outside the frame
Searching for meaning that isn’t just a name
No more distractions, break through the haze
Put down the fear that keeps us all in chains
Build conversations, let actions remain
It’s up to us now to spark a change
[End]
