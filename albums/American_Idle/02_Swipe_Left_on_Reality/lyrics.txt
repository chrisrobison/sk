[200~[Start]
[Guitar Hook]
Life reduced to swiping left and right

Scrolling through the void in the pale blue light

Profiles lined up like a deck of cards

Laughing at the boredom, hiding all our scars

[Verse 1]
Notifications chase me through another night

Itâ€™s easier to scroll than try to make it right

Everyone's performing, no one wants the truth

Chasing validation just to numb our youth[Chorus]

Swipe left of reality fading into screens

Matching with a ghost or another meme

Connection is a scroll, validation hits

Profiles in the dark pretending we exist

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa whoa empty hearts on hold

Whoa whoa dopamine so cold

[Verse 2]
I'm just another pixel in a cynical parade

Tapping out confessions to a digital charade

Filters on my feelings and the bio is clichÃ©

We chase another stranger just to fill the day

[Pre-Chorus]
We never look up from the glare

Lost in the feed we share

Wasting days in disrepair

Do you even care?

[Chorus]
Swipe left of reality fading into screens

Matching with a ghost or another meme

Connection is a scroll, validation hits

Profiles in the dark pretending we exist

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa whoa empty hearts on hold

Whoa whoa dopamine so cold[201~
