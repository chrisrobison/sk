[Start]
[Guitar Intro]
(Palm-muted power chords, fast and catchy)

[Verse 1]
Marching to the lowest bar
Thinking less gets you far
Logic's left behind the trend
Idiots get to set the end

[Pre-Chorus]
Reason drowned by empty noise
Common sense replaced by ploys
Blindly led by liars bold
Truth gets bought and cheaply sold

[Thought-Provoking Tag]
If knowledge is a crime
Then what’s the price we pay?[Chorus]
Dumbing down is trending now
Ignorance is bliss they say
Critical thought thrown away
Standing proud to be cliché

[Post-Chorus]
Hey! Hey! Stupid's all the rage!
Hey! Hey! Turn another page!

[Verse 2]
TV screens blast mindless shows
Social media feeds the flame
Fools get famous overnight
While libraries collect the dust

[Pre-Chorus]
Information at our fingertips
We choose to stay in the dark
Celebrating mediocrity
It's tearing us apart

[Chorus]
Dumbing down is trending now
Ignorance is bliss they say
Critical thought thrown away
Standing proud to be cliché

[Post-Chorus]
Hey! Hey! Stupid's all the rage!
Hey! Hey! Turn another page!
