[Verse]
Woke up feeling like I’m 90 years old
My back’s on fire my story’s been told
Used to bounce back like a rubber band snap
Now it’s two full days of this recovery trap

[Chorus]
Two day hangover it used to be one
The party’s still fun but the damage is done
I pay double the price for my good time run
Two day hangover it used to be one

[Verse 2]
Last night tequila felt like a great plan
This morning I’m dying can’t even stand
Hair of the dog but the dog bit back
Now I’m trapped in this cycle of panic attack

[Chorus]
Two day hangover it used to be one
The shots were so smooth now I’m under the gun
I party like a fool but the morning’s no fun
Two day hangover it used to be one

[Bridge]
Used to dance till dawn no care in my head
Now I’m Googling remedies from the comfort of bed
Pills and Gatorade can’t make this right
Guess I’ll feel normal by Tuesday night

[Verse 3]
The clock’s my enemy time’s not my friend
Can’t stop the party but I can’t pretend
Youth was a blessing I never did see
Now it’s two-day payback for every spree
